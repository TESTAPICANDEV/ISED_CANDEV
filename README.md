### Statement
As a communication and marketing specialist, I want to provide my senior management with a suite of dynamic interactive visualizations that combine a variety of data (contact centre, social media, web, public opinion research, media relations, etc.) with the goal of storytelling. These products should align with the various business lines and ministerial responsibilities within ISED. The outcome of these products can explore, but not be limited to the following:

Evaluating communications and marketing efforts
Comparing the effectiveness of various communications channels
Providing a visual representation of data to guide evidence-based strategy development and decision-making

### Background information

About Innovation, Science and Economic Development Portfolio

Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) is a federal government department that works in partnerships with other departments as part of the ISED portfolio. ISED works with Canadians in all areas of the economy and in all parts of the country to improve conditions for investment, enhance Canada's innovation performance, increase Canada's share of global trade and build a fair, efficient and competitive marketplace. ISED’s mission is to foster a growing, competitive and knowledge-based Canadian economy.

The department’s mandate drives all activities and services offered by ISED, such as the programs and initiatives.

About Strategic Communications and Marketing Sector (SCMS)

The experts in at SCMS advise all ISED employees about Communications and Marketing. Multiple teams exist in our group such as web development contact centre, social media, public opinion research, media relations, etc. Although teams collaborate and avoid working in silos, the sector’s data is stored in various tracking and evaluation systems. This prevents us from having a coordinated approach to metrics and data analytics to support evidence-based decision-making.

We need to standardize and formalize the use of data to ensure our activities achieve the best results and that we continuously improve by learning from our insights. This approach would not only benefit us as communications and marketing experts, but also all ISED employees developing programs and services with the end goal of helping Canadians and the economy.

Currently the evaluation of communications and marketing campaign is marginal and data analytics tools and techniques are minimal. The data is kept in silos and requests for integrated reporting must be done manually by every team.
